# ML Course

For Week 2, you'll be building 3 new Machine Learning Classifiers and programmatically finding the best parameters and features to use for them..

Week 1: Recap
What are 3 main steps in Machine Learning?
What is a 'feature' ?
What is 'classification'?
What is 'supervised learning'?
Describe kNN
Describe Cross Validation
Define Precision & Recall


Today
Some more supervised classification techniques:
Linear & Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines
Decision Trees & Random Forests


Today
Model Improvement
Variance & Bias
Parameter Optimization
Feature Selection
